# HR-SQL-Analysis

Hello, thanks for visiting my HR Dashboard Project! In this project we take a Human Resource CSV File and first clean it with SQL and then answer the main inquiries regarding the employees in the dataset. 
We focus on understanding the company well from a high level position and then dig deeper to see if any specific locations stand out regarding how long employees generally work there. There are various other
questions and key details we dig into in this dataset. The end result is a PowerBI dashboard which allows you to clearly see what the average person working in this company is like, their age, their likely department,
their average tenure within the company, race and many more important details which can help the company better understand their path for employee growth.
